        <h2>Classical Era</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="description">
      <p>This era marks a significant shift; sculptors drove towards heightened naturalism and realism throughout their creations, where human anatomy took center stage among a characteristic movement they imbued through Contrapposto - a technique that shifts weight onto one leg creating asymmetry. Polykleitos' "Spear Bearer" signifies this's success, portraying realistic proportions using Contrapposto and achieving visual harmony by emphasizing both balance in form and motion. The statue radiates harmony and idealized physical perfection, encapsulating the pursuit of the "ideal" human form.</p>

        <h2>Hellenistic Era</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="description">
      <p>The Hellenistic Era followed the Classical Era and extended from the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BCE to the establishment of the Roman Empire in 31 BCE. Hellenistic sculptures were characterized by their emotional intensity, theatricality, and increased naturalism. Artists explored various themes and depicted dramatic moments, realistic portraits, and dynamic poses. The sculptures of this era often showcased intricate details, capturing the diverse cultural influences and the changing artistic trends of the time.</p>

        <h2>Archaic Era</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="description">
      <p>The Archaic Era in ancient Greek art spanned from the 8th to the 6th century BCE. During this period, artists focused on representing figures in a more stylized and rigid manner. The sculptures often portrayed standing male or female figures known as kouroi and korai, exhibiting a sense of stillness and idealized form. The Archaic sculptures served as dedications in sanctuaries and depicted human figures in a more abstract and symbolic style.</p>
